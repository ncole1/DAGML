# DAGML
Directed Acyclic Graph Markup Language (Library and Standard)

This is the definition and Python 3.x library for the manipulation of the DAGML markup language. DAGML is a markup langauge for describing DAGs in a lightweight and easily-human-readable manner. 

The standard for the markup language (now in beta) is available in the wiki tab.

The accompanying python library for interactions will go up here in the coming weeks.
