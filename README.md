# DAGML
Directed Acyclic Graph Markup Language (Library and Standard)

This is the definition and Python 3.x reference implementation library for the manipulation of the DAGML markup language. DAGML is a markup langauge for describing DAGs in a lightweight and easily human readable manner that scale in size linearly with the number of nodes.

The DAGML standard is complete, the interaction library has now entered beta. A linter for DAGML files and a transpiler to other DAG representations used by DAG computation library are in the works. Dask will be the first to get a transpiler.

For the basis of how the DAGML language and the APIs for the different components, please see the relevent wiki pages.
