# DAGML
Directed Acyclic Graph Markup Language (Library and Standard)

This is the definition and Python 3.x library for the manipulation of the DAGML markup language. DAGML is a markup langauge for describing DAGs in a lightweight and easily human readable manner. 

The standard is almost complete, and the documentation will be updated.
The interaction library is approaching beta.

A linter for DAGML and a transpiler to other DAG representations are planned.
