The DAGML library can be installed from the PyPI Python 3.x repository, i.e. `pip3 install DAGML`, and correspondingly brought into your python session via `import DAGML`. 

With this done, a DAG object can be created, let's creatively name ours "Dag".

This can be done via `Dag=DAGML.DAG('<yourDAG>.dagml') or `Dag=DAGML.DAG(0)` to create an empty DAG object.

To save a DAG object as a DAGML file:

`Dag.export('<path>.dagml')`

By default, this will use the same number of spaces per indent as the imported DAGML file. This can be changed with the flag spacing=<n>, and will change the default behavior for the object.

The recommended number, and the default for newly created DAGs is 2. Tabs are not supported. This isn't a new front in the holy war among space users about the number of spaces or between space and tab users, but a practical issue. The DAGML files are intended to be easily human readable, and a whole tab is simply too much for reading very large DAGML files, which can have dozens of indentations. 2 spaces is what we've found to be the smallest indentation that doesn't impede reading. Unless stated otherwise, all these operations work on the DAG `Dag`.

To view the branches in Dag:

`Dag.branchesInDag()`

This command produces a list of all the branch names contained in the DAG.

To count operators in a branch:

`Dag.operatorsInBranch(branch)`

This command takes in the string input `branch` (the name of the branch) and returns the number of operators contained with the branch `branch`.

To add an operator:

`Dag.addOperator(branchName, operator, input, output, position, literal = True)`

All arguments are entered as strings. This adds an operator `operator` to the branch `branchName`. `Input` is the operator’s input, `output` is the operator’s output, and `position` is an index for where the operator is located within the branch (0 for adding it as the first operator in the branch, 1 for the second, etc.). `literal` is an inbuilt argument in an operator, for instance, the operator MultiplyBy(5|2,3) takes an input and multiplies by the number 5. The number 5 is the literal. If `literal` is not set by the user, then the new operator will not have a literal.

To remove an operator: 

`Dag.removeOperator(operator, input, output)`

All arguments entered as strings. This removes the operator `operator` with input `input` and output `output`, from the DAG. If this removal causes the branch that contained the operator to become empty, this branch will be deleted by default. The user can avoid this deletion by including as an additional argument the Boolean `clear = False`. If there are duplicates of the operator, the user may remove a specified duplicate by setting the integer `duplicateIndex`. The value of this integer should be 0 to remove the first instance of the operator, 1 to remove the second instance, and so on.

To add a branch:

`Dag.addBranch(branch, tupleStrings, operator, literal = True)`

Where `tupleStrings` refers to the slice of the branch, and `operator` refers to operator the branch is being inserted after. The command adds a new branch `branch` with slice `tupleStrings`, at the location of operator `Operator`. The format of `tupleStrings` should be like this: `('6:7','8:9')` . `literal` is an inbuilt argument in an operator, for instance, the operator MultiplyBy[5|2,3] takes an input and multiplies by the number 5. The number 5 is the literal. If `literal` is not set by the user, then the new operator will not have a literal.

To remove a branch:

`Dag.removeBranch(branch)`

Removes the branch `branch`, if it is empty (does not contain any operators), and is not subsequently involved in a `merge`. Otherwise throws an exception. The user may force the deletion of a branch with operators by including as an additional argument the Boolean  `clear = True`. This will also cause the operators in the branch to be removed. The user may force the deletion of a merged branch by including as an argument the Boolean `mergeCheck = False`.

To add a merge:

`Dag.addMerge(branchList,destination)`

Used to add a merge (merger of the branches specified in `branchList` into the branch `destination`). `branchList` is a list containing 1 or more branches.

To remove a merge:

`Dag.removeMerge(branchList,destination)`

Used to remove a merge (merger of the branches specified in `branchList` into the branch `destination`). `branchList` is a list containing 1 or more branches.

To edit operator inputs and outputs:

`Dag.editIO(operator,input,output, literal = True)`

Changes the inputs, outputs, and literal of the operator `operator` to those specified by the user. If there is more than one instance of the operator, the user may include as an additional argument the variable `duplIndex = n`, where `n` takes a value of 0 for the first instance, 1 for the second, and so on. `literal` is an inbuilt argument in an operator, for instance, the operator MultiplyBy(5|2,3) takes an input and multiplies by the number 5. The number 5 is the literal. The user may manually enter a literal at this stage. The user may include the Boolean `keepLiteral = True` in order to change only the inputs and outputs of the operator, while preserving the literal. If the user does not enter a value for `literal` or `keepLiteral`, the updated operator will not have a literal, even if the operator previously did. 

To edit the slicing of a branch:

`Dag.editSlice(branch,tupleStrings)`

Changes the branch `branch` to take in the parameters specified in `tupleStrings`. As with operator inputs and outputs, if there are multiple instances, the input `duplIndex` can be added, set to an integer value to represent the numerical index of the instance in question, starting at 0. The format of `tupleStrings` should be like this: `('6:7','8:9')` . `literal` is an inbuilt argument in an operator, for instance, the operator MultiplyBy[5|2,3] takes an input and multiplies by the number 5. The number 5 is the literal. The user may manually enter a literal at this stage. The user may include the Boolean `keepLiteral = True` in order to change only the inputs and outputs of the operator, while preserving the literal. If the user does not enter a value for `literal` or `keepLiteral`, the updated operator will not have a literal, even if the operator previously did. 

`Dag.editBranchLiteral(branch, literal = True)`

Allows the user to change the literal of a branch without altering anything else. `literal` is an inbuilt argument in an operator, for instance, the operator MultiplyBy(5|2,3) takes an input and multiplies by the number 5. The number 5 is the literal. If `literal` is not set by the user, then the new branch operator will not have a literal.

`Dag.editOperatorLiteral(operator, literal = True)`

Allows the user to change the literal of an operator without altering anything else. `literal` is an inbuilt argument in an operator, for instance, the operator MultiplyBy(5|2,3) takes an input and multiplies by the number 5. The number 5 is the literal. If `literal` is not set by the user, then the new operator will not have a literal.

`lint(Dag.dagIndents,Dag.indentSize, Dag.dagItem, Dag.dagFlows)`

Checks the DAG in the workspace for errors.
